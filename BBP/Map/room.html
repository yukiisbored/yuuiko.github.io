			Hello Friend!!<br>
			<br>
			This is my home in the imaginary place of the Magispace. This is where it all started. <br>
			<br>
			This used to be an empty void, but now over time, I've created a space of my own in here, where I come back to at the end of every day. It's where I feel home, my quiet space, and where I can really be me.<br>
			<br>
			Collected here are some of the thoughts and memories that I've had while discovering the existance of this place.<br>
			<br>
			Come and have a read! You might find how this place developed as my understanding of it grew!.<br>

		<p>
			The air is frigid and cold, but refreshing. The sun, golden, rises to stream its beams, gently caressing its tender warmth on all it touches. <br>
			<br>
			It passes through a window with a cold, olive green frame, stretching from floor to ceiling in a humble suburban cottage. Though, there was nothing special about that window anyway, all you could see out of it was only a brick wall to the right edge where an ugly water heater hanged off from.<br>
			<br>
			But it was there, in my childhood, where I sit, staring out at nothing, basking in that atmosphere. I don’t know why I was doing it, I wasn’t doing much at all.<br>
			<br>
			It seems like I was listening, to my thoughts, to my atmosphere, and to my being. I felt like I was part of something larger than myself. But i’m not sure what this is exactly<br>

		<p>
			I wonder why I have such an active imagination. Is it imagination?<br>
			<br>
			When I see someone, I seem to be able to sense what they're going through, how they are feeling and why they feel what they feel. It seems to be surprisingly accurate, whats more is that I don't need to interaction with them in any way. <br>
			<br>
			The same thing sort of happens when I look at a well made item. Theres a kind of creator's touch behind it. Someobdy created it, and I can sense their drive and passion for what they created and all the emotional energy that has gone into the creation of that item.<br>
			<br>
			Its a little strange.

		<p>
			I had a weird experience today, it was like I was able to talk to one of my close friends telepathically. I seemingly asked if he could bring something to school by just pure thought, wondering if it would work. <br>
			<br>
			To my surprise he brought that thing to school saying he thought i’d need it. A few weeks go by and this happens more than once, perhaps there’s something happening here, it’s kind of uncanny.

		<h2 style="margin-top: 0px;">4. Immersive Media and the Internet</h2>
		<p>
			I didn’t have a great day today, and I’m not able to head out somewhere peaceful like I'm guessing normal people do. I instead head to bed and explore the net for some spacious and immersive media, that’s what my peaceful space is.<br>
			<br>
			It’s of note how all the media that I love explores a concept of imaginary ambience or environment, for example I dislike most pop music because it feels dry and spaceless, only talking about petty worldly subjects. I find myself greatly enjoying expressive ambient, instrumental and emerging music much more, which are, for me, a much better immersive experience that takes you to the world of the artist.<br>
			<br>
			I can spend ages in that space, and often fall asleep, dreaming on. Eventually i’ve created some kind of space for myself within there, it’s my solitude space, happy space and kind of my real home to me now.

		<h2 style="margin-top: 0px;">5. Meeting people across the oceans</h2>
		<p>
			I have met and connected with a few people online, and they are now some of the most important people to me. No, not on a dating app, but only by pure interest within platforms that host interest-based communities. <br>
			<br>
			What I find so strange is that we have agreed that we have both somewhat felt each other even before meting online, where we both felt some connection to someone, only to discover that it was them. <br>
			<br>
			One night I began talking about such uncanny experiences: how I could feel emotions and deeper stories behind people, sense the passion of the creator behind objects, and communicate non-physically over long distances to those that were similar to me. <br>
			<br>
			It was then, while we talked about this, that we realised the idea of the Magispace. <br>
			The idea that questions, and kind of solves, “Why do we feel connected? Why do we sense human spirit? Why can we seemingly visit the imagination of another person?, and finally, at least for me, How come I could sense backstories and emotions behind people and how they feel?”<br>
			<br>
			If our imagination and spirit were all within ourselves, all this connection would not be possible. We must be connected to some nonphysical world, where we can visit to “walk through memory lane”, imagine, dream and whatever. And this non physical world would be a global thing, like the earth and our galaxy are within the universe, our home thoughts, dreams, and imagination are all part of a wider world.

		<p>
			Everything is coming together. The concept of the magispace seems clear. <br>
			<br>
			I realised that all of the music, games, movies and more of the kind I loved had a depiction of the magispace from the creators view. Weather it be the “OS space” from KIVA’s Cytus II story, outlying attraction to the Marble Machine’s Collaborative engineering, high fantasy of the movies I loved, and the sense of environment and space that the ambient music artists I found create, these people seemed to be aware of or have an active connection to the creative / imaginative world of the magispace, and are actively developing their own and dwelling in it.<br>
